the problems here flow out of its having tried to proceed according to the most universally accepted standards available to it. Consider the current flap over whether Mr. Moussaoui can depose Ramzi Binalshibh -- one of the alleged organizers of the 9/11 attacks, who was captured and is being interrogated at an undisclosed location abroad. The Sixth Amendment makes clear that "the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor." And Mr. Binalshibh's testimony, the defense argues, would lessen a jury's sense of Mr. Moussaoui's culpability and make it less inclined to impose the death penalty. Under normal circumstances, there would be no question that the defense could have access to such a witness -- nor, constitutionally speaking, should there be such question now. The Constitution's language is absolute, after all, and admits no national security exception. Fair-trial rights in American courts cannot be contingent on other governmental interests, even pressing ones. That said, the government's other interests here are very real. Mr. Moussaoui is representing himself, meaning that he would personally talk to a terrorist confederate in any deposition. It isn't unreasonable for the government to regard this as an unacceptable risk
