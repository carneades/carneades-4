In a speech that appears to have been timed for the upcoming elections, President Bush attacked the Senate this week for having a "lousy record" of confirming his judicial nominees. The facts do not bear this out. The Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed 80 judges in its first 15 months in power - more than the Republican-led Senate confirmed in its final 30 months in control, from 1999 through the summer of 2001.
