Siskiyou county apparently has been double crossed again by the state administration. The Board of Prison directors announced this week that a prison labor camp would be located in Palomar Park, near Los Angeles, to build a recreation center. Translated, that may be interpreted to read that there is virtually no chance a prison labor camp will be located in Siskiyou county to improve the badly neglected Klamath River road. http://www.jeffersonstate.com/history/doublecrossed.html
