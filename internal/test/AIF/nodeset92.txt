On the first aspect: the conflict that we undertook (rightly, I believe) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory. Both sides could (and did) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert, the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance. The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this (the atomic bomb) doesn't alter the circumstances in which the war began. It might, though, make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different. Hiroshima was the start of a process leading to the development of weaponry that made territorial struggles irrelevant. The long-distance delivery of weapons of mass destruction altered the character of war itself. Strategy reorganised itself around a balance of terror, Mutually Assured Destruction. The post-Cold War period may have seen the dissolution of this strategic assumption; but it has not taken us back to the age when nation states fought territorial campaigns. Thus initiating military action against Iraq is not a simple matter of honouring clear treaty obligations (as in 1939; the case can be made, though with some awkwardness, for the first Gulf conflict), nor of rebutting direct aggression, territorial or economic or whatever, against ourselves.
