Consistently with the doctrine of original sin, it is common among Christians to believe that if we are justified, it is by faith in Jesus.  Since we are all sinners, we cannot earn salvation by our works.  But we can be forgiven and treated as if we were righteous.  The mark of our having been forgiven is that God, by an act of grace, gives us faith.    20. This doctrine has implications I find appalling.  It implies that those among us who lack faith in Jesus have not received grace, have not been forgiven, and will, if we continue in that state, go to Hell.  So the doctrine of justification by faith, which has strong support in the Christian scriptures, leads inevitably to exclusivism, to the idea that all who reject Christian doctrine must be damned, no matter how good they may be, by ordinary standards.
