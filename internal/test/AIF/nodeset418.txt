Ken Bigley went of his own free-will but isn't that the whole purpose of reconstruction - to encourage non military personnel to help in the reconstruction of Iraq. US/UK's lack of credibility will not help convert Iraqi's to democracy. Bush/Blair are too quick to condemn ''acts of terror'' but forget that Shock and Awe was a bigger and more lethal terror attack on Iraqi and their sovereignty. I find it laughable when Blair says he will not negotiate with terrorists. Until we get out of Iraq, Iraqis and there Allies (call them what we like) will continue to use all means necessary including kidnapping. How many Westerners were 'kidnapped' prior to the invasion? talk/negotiate except
