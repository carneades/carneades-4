Elections in Pakistan are over and they have led to Islamist parties, sympathetic to the Taliban-Al Qaeda, acquiring majority status in the western provinces, besides an influential role for themselves in the governance of the country. This portends new uncertainties about the direction of Pakistan\'s policies about jehad and related violence inside and across the borders. The most likely scenario, even without the Islamic parties gaining so much ground, was an even less co-operative leadership in Islamabad than the current dispensation which had itself stonewalled all pressures to implement its promises made to India, the US and the international community to end jehadi terrorism.
