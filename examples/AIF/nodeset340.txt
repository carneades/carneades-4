Experimental medicine practiced on animals accepted the idea that, for the furtherance of human medicine, animals might be sacrificed. Soon the idea arose that, for the benefit of all mankind, some human beings could be sacrificed. At first this idea certainly raised strong inner defences, but habit always finally prevails. People begin by accepting the idea of experimenting on men under sentence of death, then comes the idea of experimenting on ordinary prisoners, and finally there arises the idea of experimenting on one s enemies! The progress of ideas is, as one sees, extremely formidable and at the same time very insidious. C. Perelman, L.
