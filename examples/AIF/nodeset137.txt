For example, just last week the subject of Thursday's hearing in the Committee on Armed Services was a proposal from the administration to exempt the De-partment of Defense from five key en-vironmental laws from the Clean Air Act to the Endangered Species Act. These laws not only protect endan-gered species and eco-systems, they protect the health of people living on and around military bases. If the ex-emptions were granted, American tax-payers and State and local govern-ments would bear the burden of clean-up costs and face public health risks from toxic contamination resulting from military operations. The evidence shows there is no reasonable case for such exemptions. The environmental laws already allow the Department of Defense to apply for exemptions on a case-by-case basis if they really need it. Both the GAO and EPA Adminis- trator Whitman have testified that en-vironmental laws have not affected military readiness. There is no evi-dence that the military has ever been refused an exemption from laws that were necessary and that they sought it.
