...scientists do not draw conclusions based on superficial resemblance. Sometimes organisms that are similar are not closely related (dolphins and sharks) and organisms that are on the surface very dissimilar (hyraxes and elephants, cetaceans and hippos) are closely related. Hyraxes or dassies, there are many other species than just Procavia capensis, have specific anatomical traits only found in elephants. How would you scientifically explain this observation? This is an excellent argument against similarity due to common design since the two organisms share many detailed antomical similarites but lead totally different lifestyles. In your language they are similar yet designed for different lifestyles. Common descent is a scientific hypothesis that can account for both similarites and differences through the principle of descent with modification, independent creation can not.
