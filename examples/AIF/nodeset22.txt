Does the Priest Scandal Reveal the Beast?" In response to Reply #0 no but it does reveal the beast under some priests. The priests scandals cannot be taken as representing the whole church without taking into account the good doen by the church and sponsored by the church worldwide, Catholic charities, hospitals, schools in most of the poorest countries in the world. Mother theresa and people likes her more than make up for the bad doen by a small minority(blown out of proportion by the media and anti-catholics) Having said this those that did wrong should and will face judgement in this life or the next.
