When a habeas petitioners claim has been adjudicated  on the merits in state-court proceedings,28 U.S.C.   2254(d)forecloses relief unless the state court  s adjudica-  tion of the claim:    (1)resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or  involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established Federal law,as determined by the Supreme  Court of the United States;or  (2)resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the  evidence presented in the State court proceeding.    The jury-coercion claim in respondent  s habeas petition is  the same claim rejected on the merits in his direct appeal  to the state appellate court,and the Ninth Circuit correctly recognized that  2254(d)was therefore applicable.  It held that respondent had established that the decision  of the Court of Appeal was contrary to established federal  law for two,and possibly three,reasons.We think none of  them correct.
